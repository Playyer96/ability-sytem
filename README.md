To implement a new Ability is necessary to inherit from AbilityBase class, after that each Ability can implement various interfaces to extend its behavior as IActivable, ICooldownable, ICostable, if the ability is active, you can pick the desired action in the inspector.

The InputMasterHelper is an extension that allows the developer to assign an action declared in the InputActionAsset to an Ability through the inspector.

A Singleton that controls cooldown for abilities.
